# Dockerized Ember

This repository is home to home to all the docker images for ember to help the development process be more streamlined and easy to setup.
For most/all projects, the only commands to get up and running are:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The only dependencies you need are  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
